        <h3>Project Synopsis</h3>

        <p>The purpose of the Game Room Recruiting project is to provide a way of rethinking the remote interview process. Companies find it difficult to be able to reach out to talent in other states and to be able to have the budget to get this talent to them. Often times companies and students that are within variables distances from each other have to find mediums of communication that provide to be ineffective and take away from the personal feel of a two way communication. Current technologies such as video chat are proving to be ineffective because they take away from the personal feel that comes with an interview.
Team D.A.A.D. will be providing a solution that helps both interviewers and students ease the process of remote interviews. We will be offering a solution that provides an immersive experience for both employers and students. Students and employers will have the feeling of being the same room from the comfort of their respectable remote locations. We want employers to be able to not only see the work the students do but for these students to be able to radiate their passion through their work. Our plan is to build a system that is not only reliable but one that provides a great user experience for all parties. We plan to create software that is not only immersive but extensible under the hood so that future features are easy to add on.
